# Descriptive Statistics - Titanic Dataset

This project explores the descriptive statistics of the Titanic dataset as part of my Data Science journey. The goal is to understand the central tendency, distribution, and variability of the data through visual and numerical summaries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Titanic `train.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Focus**: Descriptive statistics of numerical and categorical variables.
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing Summary

- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Used the cleaned dataset from previous preprocessing stage

---

## 🔍 Key Descriptive Insights

- **Age and Fare**: The distribution of `Age` is right-skewed with most passengers between 20-40 years old. `Fare` distribution is highly skewed due to a few high-paying passengers.
- **Categorical Features**: Most passengers were in 3rd class (`Pclass`). The `Sex` feature was skewed towards male passengers. Most passengers embarked from port 'S' (Southampton).
- **Boxplots** revealed outliers in both `Age` and `Fare`.
- **Histograms** provided insight into the overall spread and frequency of values in each numerical column.

## 📊 Visualizations

Saved visualizations include:

- `histogram_numerical_features.png` — Distribution of numerical columns
- `boxplot_age_fare.png` — Boxplot of `Age` and `Fare`
- `distribution_Pclass.png` — Count of passengers per class
- `distribution_Sex.png` — Count of passengers by gender
- `distribution_Embarked.png` — Count of embarkation ports

All PNG files are saved in the project directory and can be used in documentation or presentations.
